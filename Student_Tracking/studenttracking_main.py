# Purpose:      This is a Student Tracking System Application, using Python with

#
# Tested OS:    This code was written and tested to work with macOS Ventura 14.0

        self.master.maxsize(500,300) #min and max size locks the window, so it can't be resized by user

        #The goal of this widget = Menu() is to allow us to create menus that
        #can be used by our applications.

        #add_separator(): Adds a separator line to the menu.

#The (if __name__ == "__main__":) part is basically telling Python that if this script
#is ran, it should start by running the code below this line....in this case we have
#instructed Python to run the following and in this order:

#root = tk.TK() : This instantiates the Tk.() root frame (window) into being
#App = ParentWindow(root): This instantiates our own class as an App object
#root.mainloop() : it will stay open until we instruct it to close
